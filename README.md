# Rousseau
'Rousseau' is a proof-of-concept site that builds a set of comments from various sources.  It uses a set of utility php libraries that pull from both the TypePad Blog APIs and the Facebook APIs.


# Installation
* Place the index.php and tp-libraries code on the same level on your php-enabled webserver.
* View the index in your browser.  You'll see a simple comment listing from my Hobbitted "Plotzed" blog post. 
* Pick an entry.  I suggest the "Some ill sh*t is overdue..." post, since it has FB and TP comments.  Look in the Comments listing for avatars with the little Facebook icon in the corner -- that comment listing is Braided.
